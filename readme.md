## About The Project

This project is a virtual creature simulator made in python created for my 2nd school year.   

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need to [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Libraries [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/), [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/), [pygetwindow](https://pypi.org/project/PyGetWindow/) are required, you can install with
```
pip install pygame pillow pygetwindow
```
This project uses colors, therefore, ANSI support must be enabled.
You can enable it in windows 10+ running this command in windows powershell as admin:
```
reg add HKCU\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```
If you're using an older windows version, you'll need a third-party solution such as [Cmder](https://cmder.app/) or [ANSICON](http://adoxa.altervista.org/ansicon/index.html)

### Installation

Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/H1ld/Virtual_creature_simulator
```

## Usage

Open cmd: win + R `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` or terminal on linux

Go to project's root and run `main.py`
```
python main.py
py main.py
python3 main.py
```

The program can be run in any terminal (such as IDE integrated terminal), but would still recommand to run it in cmd for the best experience.

Enjoy!
